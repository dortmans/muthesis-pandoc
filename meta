author: Ibn Tufail
adviser: Ibn Bajjah
abstract: |
	Without contact with other human beings, Hayy discovers ultimate truth through a systematic process of reasoned inquiry.
	Hayy ultimately comes into contact with civilization and religion when he meets a castaway named Absal.
	He determines that certain trappings of religion and civilization, namely imagery and dependence on material goods, are necessary for the multitude in order that they might have decent lives.
	However, he believes that imagery and material goods are distractions from the truth and ought to be abandoned by those whose reason recognizes that they are distractions.
